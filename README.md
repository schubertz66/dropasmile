This repository includes a simple Ping Pong game built with Pygame and a basic NFL-themed field goal game.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pygame library

If Pygame is not installed, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the games

Execute the following command to start the Ping Pong game:

```bash
python ping_pong.py
```

Use `W`/`S` keys to move the left paddle and the Up/Down arrows for the right paddle.

To try the NFL Field Goal game, run:

```bash
python nfl_game.py
```

Move the ball left or right with the arrow keys and press `Space` to kick. Score a point by sending the ball between the uprights.
